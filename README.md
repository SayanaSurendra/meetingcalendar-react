## Working of the Project

The **Meeting Calendar App** allows users to schedule, manage, and view meetings in an organized way. Here's how the application works:

1. **Home**: 
   - When the application is launched, users land on the Home page which has a button to navigate to dashboard.
   
2. **Dashboard**:
   - The dashboard displays a sidebar for navigation to ScheduleMeeting, Manage Meeting ,Notifications and others.
   
3. **Schedule Meeting**:
   - Users can create new meetings by filling in details like title, date, time,meeting description,participants emails and meeting level.
   - Form validation is handled using **React Hook Form**.
   - Also displays a list of all scheduled meetings with **edit** and **delete** options.

3. **Edit Meeting** & **Delete Meeting**:
   
   - Each meeting entry provides options to **edit** or **delete**.  
   - Users can edit existing meetings by clicking the **Edit** button, which pre-fills the form with the current meeting details.  
   - The application uses `useParams` from **React Router** to extract the `meetingId` from the URL and load the relevant meeting data.  
   - On Delete, a pop up is displayed asking for confirmation to delete the meeting

4. **Routing**:
   - The application  uses **React Router** to handle navigation between different pages such as Scheduling, Managing, Settings, Notifications, etc.

5. **State Management**:
   - React‚Äôs built-in state hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) manage data flow.
   - Axios is used to fetch, submit ,update and delete meeting data via API calls.

6. **Notifications, Manage Meetings, Settings, and User Permissions**:
   - These sections are structured for future implementation and are accessible from the sidebar.
